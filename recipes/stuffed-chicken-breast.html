    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken breast. Boneless. You may or may not leave the skin on.</li>
            <li>Spinach. Baby spinach, chopped.</li> 
            <li>Cream cheese. Softened for easy mixing.</li> 
            <li>Sun-dried tomatoes. In oil.</li> 
            <li>Parmesan. Freshly grated.</li> 
            <li>Feta. Use feta cheese with a soft and fluffy texture. Avoid using feta that is dry and overly crumbly.</li> 
            <li>Salt and spices. I use black pepper and smoked paprika for this recipe.</li> 
            <li>Butter. To cook the chicken breasts. You can also use the cooking oil of your choice.</li>
        </ul> 
    <h3>Directions</h3>   
        <ol>
            <li>Butterfly the chicken breasts. This implies cutting the chicken breast horizontally, leaving one edge intact. Fold the chicken breast open and season the outer side with salt, pepper, and smoked paprika.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix cream cheese with grated parmesan cheese, feta cheese, chopped baby spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. Mix until well combined.</li>
            <li>Put some of the cream cheese filling on one side of the butterflied chicken breast. Fold the other side over to close the chicken breast and secure it with toothpicks.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet on medium heat. Once hot, add a knob of butter to it and brown the chicken on all sides. Cook until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees in the thickest part.</li>
        </ol>
