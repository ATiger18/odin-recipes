            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>

            <li>2 cups cooked lobster meat</li>
                
            <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
                
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul> 
    <h3>Directions</h3>   
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until caramelized and very tender, about 20 minutes.</li>

            <li>Bring chicken broth to a boil in a pot; reduce heat to low and keep at a simmer.</li>

            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large, flat-bottom pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir shallot and garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add Arborio rice to shallot mixture; cook and stir until rice begins to brown, about 3 minutes. Add wine and cook for 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Stir 1 cup chicken broth into rice mixture; cook, stirring constantly, until broth is absorbed. Repeat adding broth, 1 cup at a time, until all the broth is used, stirring constantly until broth is absorbed each time, about 30 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir honey into onions; cook and stir, 5 minutes more.</li>

            <li>Stir butter into rice mixture until melted. Add cream and stir until rice mixture thickens, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and cayenne pepper; stir well. Add sherry and mix well. Stir lobster meat into rice mixture and cook until heated through, about 3 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese into rice mixture until melted. Add onion mixture and mix well; season with salt and pepper.</li>
